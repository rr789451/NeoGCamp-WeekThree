                <h3>Why UI Design is important?</h3>
                <p>
                    When you hear about UI/UX design, the first thing that comes to mind is how beautifully they made UI for easy understanding but none think about what went into the design to make such a nice and clean design. Always while designing a website or app think from the end-user perspective rather than the technical perspective. End users don't care much about what you did but they want to easily navigate through the application without much hassle. Most of the applications contain a specific place where they want the user to visit while browsing, to do that most of the designers create a curiosity to the users by giving a link or mentioning it again and again which will most likely lead the user to that page.
                </p>
                <h3>Choosing Colors for the Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Choosing the right combination of colors is always hard because the designer doesn't want the user to feel uncomfortable while browsing the application. So he has to choose appropriate colors such that they won't affect the mood of the user rather they want the user to feel comfortable. For the comfort of the user most designers do not go for a wide range of colors instead they stick to two or three colors that are enough bright for the user to see and understand the content, but not too bright which might make the user uncomfortable.
