                <h1>First Experience with ReactJS</h1>
                <small>SEPTEMBER 2021</small>
                <h3>Starting days with ReactJS</h3>
                <p>
                    When I first heard about ReactJS, I didn't know a single thing about that was wondering why it was called a framework and how it was different from normal HTML. I started going through the official documentation of ReactJS. After nearly a one-hour read I barely understood what JSX means, what are functional components, what does it mean by rendering etc. Frankly, it was a little too much overwhelming for me. At that moment I realized without experimenting with it I wouldn't understand anything. Then I started to code with the help of documentation and some youtube tutorials, at first it seemed easy and slowly I was starting to understand the basic concepts of ReactJS.
                </p>
                <h3>Second Obstacle in Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Once I started to understand ReactJS I became over-confident which was one of the biggest mistakes I made while learning ReactJS. With that overconfidence I tried to do some basic website, at that moment it hit me pretty hard in my face about how much knowledge I lacked. It made me realize how much more I need to practice and it changed the way of my learning pattern. After that, I focused mainly on the documentation and started practicing small programs to better understand how things go on in ReactJS. Still practicing and I think I have improved a bit since last time.
